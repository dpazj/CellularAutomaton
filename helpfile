CellularAutomaton by Joe Riemersma and Claire Sommerville
This application produces a basic Cellular Automaton.

CLI Arguments:
	./CA Usage:  [-a] [-help]

	-help:
		Displays help file.

	-a | --automaton:
		Cell automaton feature. Must be followed by three arguments.
		Usage: 
		./CA -a [seqinput=<'sequenceSize'> | seqdefault=<'sequenceSize' | seqcustom]	[rulesetinput=<'ruleset'> | rulesetdefault | rulesetcustom] 	
		[iterationall=<'repetitions' | iterationsingl=<'repetitions'>]	 [-s=<'outputfile'>]


	Argument 1:
		seqinput='sequenceSize':
			Specifies how many bits the initial and subsequent rows will contain.
			Will create a random sequence with 'sequenceSize' number of bits.

		seqdefault='sequenceSize':
			Specifies how many bits the initial and subsequent rows will contain.
			Will use a default sequence containing a single '1' in the middle of the
			sequence. Sequence will contain 'sequenceSize' number of bits.

		seqcustom:
			User enters their own custom sequence

	Argument 2:
		rulesetinput='ruleset':
			Specifies what ruleset will be used in the generation of child sequences.
			A binary bitset will be created from integer 'ruleset'.

		rulesetdefault:
			Ruleset will use default value of '30' - '00011110'.

		rulesetcustom:
			User enters their own custom bitset.

	Argument 3:
		iterationall='repetitions':
			Specifies the number of different sequences the program will produce.
			Will produce all generations at once. Produces 'repeitions' number of generations.

		iterationsingle='repetitions': 
			Specifies the number of different sequences the program will produce. 
			Will only show next sequence when user presses a key. Will produce 'repeitions' number of times.

	Options:
		-s='outputfile' | --save:
			Writes the generated sequences to 'file1'.

		-w | --wrap:
			Wraps sides around to other side.
			Note: this setting is off by defualt.
